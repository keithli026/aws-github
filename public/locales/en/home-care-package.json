      "description": "The Home Care Package (HCP) is a government-funded program that helps older Australians get care and support at home, so they can keep living independently for as long as possible. There are four levels of support—Level 1 is for basic care, while Level 4 is for high level care. This funding can be used for many various services, including care management, personal care, clinical care such as physiotherapy, dietary support, mobility support, and home modifications."
